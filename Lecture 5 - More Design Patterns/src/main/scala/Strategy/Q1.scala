package Strategy

// Q1.a. Describe the Strategy Design Pattern
//
// The strategy design pattern includes an interface for a set of classes
// that define different algorithms.  These are all interchangeable.  The
// interface is then referenced within a class which can use these
// different algorithms interchangeably.
// 
// Q1.b.
// 
// The strategy design pattern should be used when you need to define a
// number of classes that differ only in their behaviour and should be
// used interchangeably so that different algorithms can be used at runtime.
